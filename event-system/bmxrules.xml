1. You're not required to roleplay stunts, jumps and tricks. This is to avoid bind spam and saving time mashing keys whilst controlling your character mid-air etc.

2. All injuries and falls must be roleplayed.

3. Roleplay your characters ability to BMX realistically. A 69 year old grandma realisticaly is not going to jump on a bike and start riding, pulling mad tricks etc.

4. If you spot a player not abiding by these rules, /report them to an admin. The player will  be dealt with accordingly. 

Scripts: 
Whilst inside the skatepark, the possibility to do fakies(coast backwards), pedal faster and jump high is activated.
By using 'Q' and 'E' you're able to better rotate in order to do rotary tricks like 180's, 360's, flairs etc.
Gravity is slightly lower to allow for smoother transitions and better physics whilst using the verts.
